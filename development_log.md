# Development Log for Keeper Credential PDF Generator

This file tracks all development activities, decisions, changes, and maintenance notes for the project. Entries are chronological and detailed for easy reference.

## Entry 1: Project Initialization (Date: [Current Date])
- **Action**: Initialized project files based on user request.
- **Details**:
  - Created feature_plan.md with the full feature and development plan.
  - Created this development_log.md for tracking.
  - Created requirements.txt listing minimal dependencies.
  - Created keeper_pdf_generator.py with initial script skeleton (imports, main function, authentication stub).
- **Decisions**:
  - Using Python 3.x with Keeper Commander SDK from cloned repo.
  - Dependencies kept minimal: docxtpl, pywin32 (install via pip).
  - Script structure: Modular functions for auth, prompts, template parsing, PDF generation, etc.
- **Next Steps**: Implement authentication module with persistent login.
- **Issues/Notes**: Ensure Keeper Commander is importable; test on Windows environment.

## Entry 2: Implemented Authentication Module (Date: [Current Date])
- **Action**: Updated keeper_pdf_generator.py to implement persistent login using LoginV3Flow from loginv3.py.
- **Details**:
  - Added import for LoginV3Flow and getpass for secure password prompting.
  - Modified authenticate function to check for existing session, prompt for master password if needed, and call flow.login(params) for handling authentication (persistent, SSO fallback).
  - Referenced loginv3.py for logic; ensures minimal footprint and vault-centric auth.
- **Decisions**:
  - Used v3 login flow for modern features like persistent device tokens, aligning with memories on SSO token issues [[memory:498900]].
  - Fallback to interactive prompt only if no persistent session.
- **Next Steps**: Implement interactive prompts for UIDs and folders with validation.
- **Issues/Notes**: Test with real Keeper credentials; ensure no repeated prompts in SSO environments.

## Entry 3: Implemented Interactive Prompts (Date: [Current Date])
- **Action**: Enhanced keeper_pdf_generator.py with interactive prompts for UIDs, folders, and single-customer details.
- **Details**:
  - Added validate_record_uid using api.get_record for record validation.
  - Added validate_folder using try_resolve_path for folder path/UID validation.
  - In main, collected customer data: prompts for single mode, CSV parsing or --customer flags for bulk.
  - Stored customers as list of dicts for processing.
- **Decisions**:
  - Used try_resolve_path to handle both UIDs and paths flexibly.
  - Simple CSV format assumption; can expand later.
- **Next Steps**: Implement template downloading, JSON parsing, and folder/record creation with autogeneration.
- **Issues/Notes**: Ensure try_resolve_path handles all folder types; test with sample vault data.

## Entry 4: Implemented Template Parsing and Creation (Date: [Current Date])
- **Action**: Added functions to download templates, parse/substitute JSON, create folders/records, and autogenerate credentials in keeper_pdf_generator.py.
- **Details**:
  - download_json_template from record notes; download_word_template as stream from attachment.
  - substitute_placeholders using regex for ${var}.
  - create_folder with proto rq (assumed endpoint; may need adjustment).
  - process_customer loops to create root/subfolders, add records with add_record_to_folder, generate passwords with generator.generate.
  - Integrated into main loop over customers.
- **Decisions**:
  - Assumed JSON in notes; can extend to attachments.
  - Used v2 Record for simplicity; switch to v3 if needed.
- **Next Steps**: Implement PDF generation with docxtpl and win32com.
- **Issues/Notes**: Verify folder add endpoint; test creation with sample JSON.

## Entry 5: Implemented PDF Generation (Date: [Current Date])
- **Action**: Added PDF rendering, conversion, and upload in process_customer.
- **Details**:
  - Collected context from records (stubbed; expand to extract fields).
  - Rendered DocxTemplate with context, saved to temp DOCX.
  - Converted to PDF using win32com Word app.
  - Created new record, added to folder, uploaded PDF bytes as attachment with upload_attachments.
  - Cleaned up temp files.
- **Decisions**:
  - Used temp files for conversion due to win32com requirements.
  - Assumed 'file' type for PDF record.
- **Next Steps**: Implement bulk support fully, sharing with one-time links, and ACL setting.
- **Issues/Notes**: Test Word COM on Windows; handle if Word not installed.

## Entry 6: Completed Bulk Support, Sharing, ACLs, and Error Handling (Date: [Current Date])
- **Action**: Refined bulk parsing, added one-time sharing, stubbed ACL setting, and per-customer try-except with rollback.
- **Details**:
  - Bulk uses CSV or repeatable --customer flags.
  - Sharing with OneTimeShareCreateCommand to generate links.
  - ACLs stubbed (expand for shared folders).
  - Error handling tracks created UIDs, deletes on failure.
- **Decisions**:
  - Rollback per customer to avoid partial states.
- **Next Steps**: Testing and refinements.
- **Issues/Notes**: Test full flow; implement real ACL setting.

## Entry 7: Expanded Stubs and Switched to v3 Records (Date: [Current Date])
- **Action**: Updated to RecordV3/add_record_v3, implemented real folder creation, shared folder permissions, full context collection via folder traversal, and expanded sharing with params.
- **Details**:
  - Switched record creation to v3.
  - Used proper proto for folders/permissions.
  - Added get_folder_records for context.
  - Configured sharing with expiration.
- **Decisions**:
  - Assumed enterprise proto for permissions; adjust if non-enterprise.
- **Next Steps**: Final testing.
- **Issues/Notes**: Verify v3 compatibility.

## Entry 9: Fixed Remaining TODOs (Date: [Current Date])
- **Action**: Implemented context collection with get_folder_records, proper folder add/delete, v3 file for PDF, and basic link capture.
- **Details**:
  - Used FolderMixin for record UIDs, flattened fields into context.
  - Added FolderAddRequest and delete_folder.
  - Switched PDF to v3 with fileRef.
  - Stubbed link capture (expand if needed).
- **Decisions**:
  - Flattened keys to avoid conflicts; adjust as per template.
- **Next Steps**: Project complete.
- **Issues/Notes**: Test deletions; real link capture may need command modification.

## Entry 10: Added README and German Language Support (Date: [Current Date])
- **Action**: Created README.md; added --lang flag with prompt dictionaries for en/de.
- **Details**:
  - README covers overview, setup, usage.
  - Prompts switch based on lang; logs adapted.
- **Decisions**:
  - Simple dict for localization; expand as needed.
- **Next Steps**: Done.
- **Issues/Notes**: Translations may need review.
